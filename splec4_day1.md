# My Project
I've been a swimmer for over 10 years, but I'm still not good at backstroke (by the way, my specialty is breaststroke).

Is there any swimming method that you are **not** good at?

1. Crawl(クロール)
2. Backstroke(背泳ぎ)
3. Breaststroke(平泳ぎ)
4. Butterfly(バタフライ)
5. None
6. All
7. Others

Answers
1. Backstroke
2. AAA(privious commandline)
